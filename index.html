  <h1>Welcome to My Cool First Webpage!</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is my first attempt at creating a webpage using basic HTML. It's part of my journey into web development!</p>

  <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
  <p>I’ve added headings, paragraphs, and even an image that links to another website. Pretty cool, right?</p>

  <h3>More About Me</h3>
  <p>I’m learning how to code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This page will evolve as I learn more.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned for more awesome projects, updates, and web experiments.</p>
